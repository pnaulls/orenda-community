Introduction
------------

This is an open source version of the fimware, Android App and iOS App software for the Orenda coffee maker, produced by the Auroma Brewing Company (ABC)

Have fun. Have coffee.

Why, haven't ABC produced their own?
------------------------------------

Their firmware appears buggy, as does the iOS App and crashes on tablets. The Android App remains AWOL.  This project is completely independent of them, and doesn't not make any use of their code.  ABC's customer service leaves much to be desired.

The intent is to be open about we're doing.  The result may not be for everyone, and the way the apps work will likely be very different to the ABC version, but we think this is going to be powerful, useful and fun.

How can I use this?
-------------------

You can't, not yet. This is early development and we have a long road.  Think months, not weeks.
